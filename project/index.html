    <h2 class="city">Why Schawarma?</h2>
    <p>In this beautiful period of peace in the Middle East we must celebrate the great contributions countries such as Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Tukey, and Qatar (among others) have contributed to the world. Despite innovations such as OPEC, robot jockey, chess, algebra, early surgery, and the iron dome,the 22 countries in what we call the "middle east" have one major endownment for the 21st century: Shawarma, Schwarma, Shwarma, Szhwarma, Szawamra.....or however you want to spell it. </p>

    
    <p>This topic in particular has a very personal appeal to me. Not only am I a frequent eater of Middle Eastern Quisine, I also happen to have genological experience in shawarma. My great great grandfather came to this country when the Ottoman empire was still running. Before leaving he turned to his father, who was too old to take the trip, and said "father, can I have something to bring to America? Something so I can begin saving and afford to bring my sisters over?" 
    
        And his father looked him in the eye and said "The point of going to AMERICA is to make money on your own, you dimwit! But here, for your travels." And he handed my great great grandfather...a schwarma. The schwarma, which was only supposed to last one day, lasted the whole trip to America. And when my great-great grandfather came to America, he opened a Schwarma stand in Philadelphia and made a fortune selling to all new Ottoman immigrants.
        
        Okay, that entire story is a lie. But I do love Schwarma!</p>
