    <h2 class="city">Shwarmian History</h2>
    <p>Shwarma was first created in the Ottoman empire, by a Mr. Hadji Iskender in th 19th century. Iskender had the idea of stuffing pita with condiments (such as french fries, tomatoes, lettuce, HUMMUS, etc) and meat cooked off a spit of stacked meat (spits use string to hold meat together when it's being roasted). The Mediterranean chef world loved the aspect of cooking lamb, beef, and chicken vertically. Chef Gordon Ramsey personally visited Iskender and told him that "this meat is so vertical, I thought it was standing up." No one really got Gordon's sense of humor in the Ottoman empire. They were still on "your mom" jokes, and had just gotten over "I know you are but what am I". </p>

  <h3 class="town">Shwarma in Politics</h3>
  <p>The political side of shwarma is not nearly as delicious as the schwarma itself. Footage surfaced recently on "The Onion" reveals that Archduke Ferdinand was not shot, but actually poisoned with Schawarzma. Infowars.com uncovered the truth about Abraham Lincoln: pelted with Shwarma to death. As tasty as Shwarma is, we must always remember the its nasty past. Tainted darker than Tahini, and stronger than jalenpeno hummus.</p>

  <h3 class="hamlet">Shwarma and the "Shwarmageddon" Controversy</h3>
  <p> On April 30th, 2016 Moscow officials banned Shwarma booths in the streets due to hygiene protocol breaches. They were met with protests and mobs and Russians shouted to save their shwarma. Luckily, the matter was resolved as Moscow officials repealed the ban. Crisis averted. </p>
